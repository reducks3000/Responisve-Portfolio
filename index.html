            <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p class="one">
                I was born in Austin, Texas on April, 7th 1990! I love to mess around with
                technology and trying new types of music. I've been playing games for all my life and i'm very
                knowledgeable about games and systems!
                </p>

                <p class="two"> My interest in being a Web Developer started because of all the friends I have that 
                very much enjoy their jobs and I was very curious myself. I like working on puzzles and 
                coding is just that!
                </p>
